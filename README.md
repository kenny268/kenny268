👋I'm a software developer with a passion for building innovative solutions. I specialize in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

👨‍💻 I have experience working with a variety of frameworks including Django, Django Rest Framework, Express.js, Node.js, Gatsby, Graphql with Node.js, React.js, and React Native.


🔭 I'm currently expanding my skills by learning new technologies and tools. I'm currently focused on learning DevOps, which I believe will help me improve my development workflow and make it easier to deploy my applications


🚀 I love to collaborate with other developers and designers to build amazing products that solve real-world problems. I enjoy being a part of a team that is dedicated to creating user-centric solutions that make a difference in people's lives.



🌱 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or reading a good book. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and personal development, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills.
